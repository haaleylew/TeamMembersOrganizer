This Profile Generator is a command-line application using node that uses userinput about members of a team and renders an HTML page showing that information.
The user is asked to describe the first member of their team, then they enter the team member's name, role from a list (engineer, intern, or manager),member's ID and email address. If "Engineer" was entered, then the app asks the user for the team member's GitHub username. if "Intern" was selected, the member's school is requested; and if "Manager", then user is prompted for the team member's phone number.
